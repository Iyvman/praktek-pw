    <h1>Web Design</h1>
   <br>
    <p> <font color="red">Web design</font> encompasses many different skills and disciplines in the production and maintenance of <b>websites</b>. The different areas of web design include web graphic design; <b> interface design</b> (UI design); authoring, including standardised <font color="blue">code</font> and <b>proprietary software; user experience design</b> (UX design); and <b>search engine optimization</b>. Often many individuals will work in teams covering different aspects of the design process, although some designers will cover them all.[1] The term "web design" is normally used to describe the design process <font color="green">relating</font> to the front-end (client side) design of a website including writing markup. Web design partially overlaps <b>web engineering</b> in the broader scope of <b>web development</b>. Web designers are expected to have an awareness of <b>usability</b> and be up to date with <b>web accessibility guidelines</b>.</p>
